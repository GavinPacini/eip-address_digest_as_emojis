## Simple Summary
We propose a standard method for creating a digest of an Ethereum address represented as a series of emojis, which are human-friendly.

## Abstract
This ERC proposes a method to avoid address substitution attacks (such as [the recent one against the CEO of Nexus Mutual](https://twitter.com/nexusmutual/status/1338441873560571906)) by creating human readable digests of addresses composed of four simple emojis. These are easier for humans to recognize, remember and recount than hexadecimal strings, and would bring a number of security & usability benefits.

## Motivation
Mitigate attacks like [the recent one against CEO of Nexus Mutual](https://twitter.com/nexusmutual/status/1338441873560571906). Based on [Telegram's implementation for encrypted voice calls](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end/voice-calls#key-verification). Address substiution is a common attack vector. Yet, showing only the first four and last four characters of an address is still a de-facto standard. There are some exising methods of visualising addresses as images with higher entropy than four emojis, however on a "human-readability" scale, the authors believe emojis to be much more user friendly. This would be easily implementable on different software and hardware wallets. Also, it would be very easy to send out-of-band i.e. via another means the same four emojis in order to verify the address. E.g. over a phone call, one could simple say "0, Traffic Lights, Film Clapperboard, T-Shirt" for 0Ô∏è‚É£ üö¶ üé¨ üëï.

## Specification
Using a [specific subset of 333 emojis](./assets/emoji-list.json) which have been chosen based on uniqueness and based on Telegram's list:
 - create an scrypt hash of your address in hex (without the `0x` prefix), with the salt also equal to the same address bytes. *Should maybe think more about the salt...*
 - split this hash into chunks of 16 bytes
 - for each chunk mod the value by the length of the possible emojis to get an index
 - assign the emoji based on the calculated index
 - repeat for all hash chunks

## Rationale
This design is based on the fact that Emojis are easier to describe and validate than 20 bytes of hex. Of course,  emojis out of 333 (333^4 possibiltiies ‚à¥ approximately 33 bits of entropy) are still less entropy than 20 bytes of hex (320 bits of entropy), but they are considerably more than the current de-facto standard of the first 2 bytes and last 2 bytes (32 bits of entropy).

It is also considered to add more than 4 emojis in order to decrease the attack surface of a collision. 

## Backwards Compatibility
This is a new method of verifying addresses in a human-friendly manner and would not create any backwards compatibility issues.

## Reference Implementation
Requires python3 and scrypt (`pip3 install scrypt`).
```python
import scrypt
import json
import sys

def chunks(lst, n):
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        yield lst[i:i + n]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open('./emoji-list.json') as emoji_list:
      data = json.load(emoji_list)
      emojis = list(data)

      address = bytes(bytearray.fromhex(sys.argv[1]))

      addr_hash = scrypt.hash(address, address)

      emoji_str = ""
      for i in chunks(addr_hash, 16):
          hash_chunk = int.from_bytes(i, "big")
          idx = hash_chunk % len(emojis)
          emoji_str += emojis[idx] + " "
      print(emoji_str)
```

Running:  
`python3 script.py 8Cd5fB2229fbB84E260dd03c392c9621CdDc4820`  
Outputs:  
0Ô∏è‚É£ üö¶ üé¨ üëï  

Which could look something like this in Metamask (mockup):

## Security Considerations
Brute forcing a few characters of an address has become relatively novel. [Matching eight characters on a GTX 1070 OC takes ~24s](https://github.com/cenut/vanity-eth-gpu). By introducing what is effectively a human-readable address digest we believe this would be a net gain to the security of Ethereum address verification. Brute force attackers would now need to find matching addresses and emoji-strings in order to successfully perform address substitution attacks.
